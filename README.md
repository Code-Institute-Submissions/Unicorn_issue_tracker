# Project Name: Unicorn Attractor Bug Issue Tracker
I decided to use the sample brief given to students for the project to create a web application that allows users 
to log Bugs that they find with the fictional application and also to add features they would like developed. They can upvote
bugs and features once they have registered on the site and can add features to a shopping cart and checkout.

* Project has been published to the Heroku website https://bugissue-tracker.herokuapp.com
* The github repository is located at https://github.com/desflaherty/Unicorn_issue_tracker


## UX

*Strategy:*
The intention for this project would be to create a bug issue tracker application that is responsive and visually appealing 
and uses the frameworks and technologies covered thus far in the course.

*User Stories:*
As a user of the issue tracker I should be able to: 

* Browse existing bugs and features when not registered
* Register with the site and then login using a username or email address
* View my profile information
* Once logged in add bugs or features that I would like developed
* Upvote bugs and features and also add features to my cart and complete the checkout process
* Search for existing bugs and features that have already been created by other users
* View the status of each bug or feature to see what is currently being worked on
* View graphs summarising the total issues being tracked by the web app by their current status

A mockup for the proposed cookbook can be viewed on github

## Existing Features
*Header and Footer*
* A navigation bar is displayed with a logo which links to the homepage
* Links are displayed on the right hand side of the navigation menu to allow for browsing of issues or registration
* Once logged in more links become available such as a profile and graphs section
* On mobile or iPad view the navigation bar will collapse to display a tiled dropdown menu
* A footer is displayed at the bottom of the screen throughout the website
